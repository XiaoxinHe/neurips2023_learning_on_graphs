# NeurIPS 2023 Papers Repository

Welcome to the NeurIPS 2023 Papers Repository! 

This repository contains tools to collect and filter papers accepted by the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2023. Whether you're interested in exploring the entire list of accepted papers or searching for specific topics, this repository has you covered.


## 1. Data Collection

Run the ```collect.py``` script using the following command:
```
python collect.py
```

The resulting paper details will be saved in ```neurips2023.csv```.




## 2. Searching for Papers with Keywords





To filter and search for papers that match your interests, you can utilize the ```main.ipynb```. Simply replace the provided example keywords with your own terms.

It's important to note that this filtering mechanism primarily relies on the **titles** of the papers. 

Consequently, while many relevant papers will be captured, there is a possibility that some papers pertinent to your research interest might not be included in the results.
